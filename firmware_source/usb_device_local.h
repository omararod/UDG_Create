  Description:
    USB Device Stack File
    
    This file contains functions, macros, definitions, variables,
    datatypes, etc. that are required for usage with the MCHPFSUSB device
    stack. This file should be included in projects that use the device stack.
    
    This file is located in the "\<Install Directory\>\\Microchip\\USB"
    directory.
    
    When including this file in a new project, this file can either be
    referenced from the directory in which it was installed or copied
    directly into the user application folder. If the first method is
    chosen to keep the file located in the folder in which it is installed
    then include paths need to be added so that the library and the
    application both know where to reference each others files. If the
    application folder is located in the same folder as the Microchip
    folder (like the current demo folders), then the following include
    paths need to be added to the application's project:
    
    .
    ..\\..\\MicrochipInclude
    
    If a different directory structure is used, modify the paths as
    required. An example using absolute paths instead of relative paths
    would be the following:
    
    C:\\Microchip Solutions\\Microchip\\Include
    
    C:\\Microchip Solutions\\My Demo Application

 File Description:

 Change History:
  Rev    Description
  ----   -----------
  2.8    Initial revision.  Contents extracted from the previous usb_device.c 
         file, so as to make the usb_device.c file less cluttered.
         Fixed BD() and EP() macro computation error, when running in
         USB_PING_PONG__EP0_OUT_ONLY mode.
  2.9    No functional change.  Fixed spelling typo in the name of 
         "USB_TRANSFER_COMPLETE_HANDLER()"
